FarNet 5.2.1

= 0.10.0 =

Interactive

	Generated file names with time stamps are used for interactives. You may
	save interactive files for later analysis but they are not supposed to be
	reused as interactives.

	Interactive input is stored in a common history file.
	Use [F6] in order to get the interactive history.

Misc

	"Load" uses local .fs.ini and .fsproj, if any.
	Fix an error on loading an updated config file.

= 0.9.0 =

Symbol definitions and references
- Menu "Uses in file" shows uses in the file
- Menu "Uses in project" show uses in the project

= 0.8.1 =

Tips
- Use info from XML docs.

= 0.8.0 =

fs: //open

	Support ".fsproj" as interactive configuration in addition to ".fs.ini".
	Currently all compiled ".fs" files are automatically loaded.
	This is very handy on developing small projects.
	This is slow and rather useless for large.

Auto #load and #use

	On opening interactive with "config.ext", existing files "config.load.fsx"
	and "config.use.fsx" are automatically loaded and used as input. This is
	designed for "config.fsproj" but works for "config.ini" as well.

fs: //exec ... [;; <F# code>]

	Support an optional F# code invoked after loading a file.
	This is the official way to call something with parameters.

= 0.7.1 =

- Improve code completion.
- Avoid opening a session on checks.
- Cache INI configurations on checking.
- Fix conflict between F# and FSF commands.
- Add a sanity check on reading INI config.

= 0.7.0 =

Configuration
- Make configuration from .fsproj when .fs.ini is missing.

Misc
- Improve code completion.

= 0.6.0 =

Proper F# code completion based on configuration info.

= 0.5.0 =

New menu in F# editors
- "Tips"

Misc
- Interactive files .fs.fsx are in the local profile.

= 0.4.1 =

- Work around console output problems (Mantis 3297)
- Support relative "reference" | "load" | "lib" | "use"

= 0.4.0 =

Configuration
- Rename files *.fsi.* -> *.fs.*
- Two sections [fsc] and [fsi]

New menus in F# editors
- "Check"
- "Errors"

= 0.3.4 =

Fix double code completion in interactive.

= 0.3.3 =

Adapt for Far 3.0.4782.
Show echo on `fs: code`.

= 0.3.2 =

Avoid command echo, it makes issues in Far 3.0.4782.
Fixed unwanted modal interactive sessions on //open.

= 0.3.1 =

Avoid loading session on some [Tab] in editor.
Show session loading progress state and title.
fsi.exe does not have to be in the path.

= 0.3.0 =

Use Far 3.0.4775, its FarColorer supports F# syntax highlighting.

The new menu command "Load" in editor saves and loads the current script in the
main session. Its output, warnings, and errors are shown in another editor.

Code completion in editors works for all F# files. Completions is currently
based on the main session, you may configure it using "main.fsi.ini".

Amended //exec for scripts with console output functions (printf, etc.)
So //exec is fine for all scripts, except dealing with console directly.

= 0.2.0 =

Revised the module and F# sessions.
Added commands //exec and //open.
Updated README.

= 0.1.0 =

Code completion by [Tab] in F# interactive editors.

= 0.0.2 =

MSBuild 14 (VS 2015) is required instead of MSBuild 12 (VS 2013).

= 0.0.1 =

Public preview.
