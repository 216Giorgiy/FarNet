FarNet is the framework for .NET modules and Windows PowerShell in Far Manager.

Far Manager is a file manager for Microsoft Windows. In addition to file system
tools it provides the console command line, file viewer, and text editor with
syntax highlighting.

Far Manager is also the platform for numerous plugins. Plugins can be created
using its C and Pascal API or using wrappers which allow development in other
languages.

FarNet is such a wrapper. It exposes the .NET API in object oriented way and
provides the runtime infrastructure for its modules.

One of the modules is PowerShellFar. It implements the Windows PowerShell host
and turns Far Manager into the console based integrated scripting environment.
